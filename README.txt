UMD Identifier v0.1 by harleyg - http://www.linuxlabs.co.uk
-----------------------------------------------------------
Ok, so this is the 1st program ive released, all it does it look through a giant 
array of UMD ID's/codes and compairs yours to everyone in the array, if it finds
a matching pair it will look through and find the name of it in a second array.

This is confirmed to work by myself on 1.50, i havnt tested on any other 
firmwares so please let me know... also, if your game name doesnt show up, copy
down the game ID it gives you and post it on the "umd code" thread on 
PSPUpdates, including the game name and its region (UK/Europe/USA/JAP etc.)

Thanks to the guys at pspupdates and cppnewbie for helping me find all of the umd
codes...

Oh, this isnt released under any license, however if you use this it would be 
nice to get a little credit...

chow.
